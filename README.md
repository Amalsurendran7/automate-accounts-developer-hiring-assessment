Overview
This project provides a RESTful API to:

Upload PDF receipt files (max 10MB).
Validate PDFs for integrity.
Extract text and structured data (e.g., merchant name, total amount) using Tesseract OCR (free users) or Together AI (premium users).
Store and retrieve receipt data in a SQLite database.

The API is built with FastAPI, uses SQLModel for ORM, and includes Alembic for database migrations. Itâ€™s packaged as a zip file with a Postman collection for testing.
Tech Stack

FastAPI: High-performance API framework.
SQLModel: ORM combining SQLAlchemy and Pydantic.
SQLite: Lightweight database for file metadata and receipt data.
Together AI: AI-based text extraction for premium users.
Tesseract OCR: OCR for free users.
PyPDF2: PDF validation.
Alembic: Database schema migrations.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+: Ensure Python is installed.
Tesseract OCR: Required for OCR (see Tesseract Installation).
Virtual Environment: For dependency isolation.
requirements.txt: Included in the zip root for Python packages.

Installation

Unzip the Project:

Extract the zip file. The root contains:
app/: Application code.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies.
collection.json: Postman collection.
alembic.ini: Alembic configuration.
README.md: This file.




Set Up Virtual Environment:
cd path/to/project
python -m venv venv

Activate:

Windows:venv\Scripts\activate


Linux/macOS:source venv/bin/activate




Install Python Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Install Tesseract:

See Tesseract Installation for your OS.
Ensure tesseract.exe is in app/Tesseract/exe/ (included) or system PATH.


Configure Together AI (Optional):

For premium user text extraction, set the API key:export TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # Linux/macOS
set TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY="your-api-key"     # Windows


Update app/services/llm/utils.py to use this key.


Set Up Database:

Initialize SQLite database (database.db) with Alembic:alembic upgrade head




Run the Application:
uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload


Access at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.



API Usage
The API provides endpoints for receipt management. Test them via Swagger UI (http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) or the included Postman collection (collection.json).

Testing with Postman

Import collection.json (in the zip root) into Postman.
Set the base URL to http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Test endpoints as described above.

Database Migrations with Alembic
The project uses Alembic for SQLite database migrations:

Initialize the schema:alembic upgrade head


For schema changes:alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
alembic upgrade head




Ensure alembic.ini points to sqlite:///database.db.
